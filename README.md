# ML Experiments

This repo contains the progress of our experiments in form of Jupyter Notebooks


The datasets we used are mostly from [ kaggle ](https://www.kaggle.com/)


Initally we started using [ fastai ](https://www.fast.ai/), one of the fantastic libraries out there for working with neuralnets. There is
also online course taught by Jeremy Howard [ course ](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1) which would be a great starting point for
Deeplearning Aspirants
